## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES 🚨

### 0. Work Preservation (NEVER LOSE CODE) 🚨🚨🚨

**Core principle:** NEVER discard uncommitted work. ALWAYS ask first.

## ❌ FORBIDDEN without EXPLICIT user permission:

**MUST ask user before running ANY of these commands:**
- `git reset` (any form: `--soft`, `--mixed`, `--hard`)
- `git revert`
- `git checkout -- <file>`
- `git checkout HEAD -- <file>`
- `git restore` (to discard changes)
- `git stash drop`
- `rm` / deleting tracked files

**NO EXCEPTIONS. NO SHORTCUTS. ALWAYS ASK FIRST.**

1. **These commands require EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION:**
   - STOP before executing
   - ASK: "May I run `[exact command]`?"
   - WAIT for explicit "yes" or approval
   - Only then proceed

2. **NEVER decide on your own to revert/discard/delete work**
   - Even if tests fail
   - Even if you think the approach is wrong
   - Even if you want to try a different approach
   - Even if it seems like the obvious thing to do

## ✅ MANDATORY WORKFLOW when you want to revert/change approach:

**STEP 1: ALWAYS save first**
```bash
git diff > .claude/backups/work-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).patch
```

**STEP 2: ALWAYS ask the user**
Use AskUserQuestion tool:
- "Tests are failing. Should I: (a) keep debugging, (b) save and try different approach, (c) revert to last working state?"
- WAIT for user response before ANY destructive action

**STEP 3: Only proceed after explicit user approval**

## When tests fail on experimental code:

1. **DO NOT REVERT** - the work has value even if broken
2. Save to backup: `git diff > .claude/backups/failing-code.patch`
3. ASK user what to do next
4. Options to present:
   - Continue debugging
   - Commit as WIP: "WIP: experimental (tests failing)"
   - Try different approach (after saving)

**Backup location:** `.claude/backups/` - ALWAYS use this folder

**Recovery:** If work was lost, check:
- `.claude/backups/` - saved patches
- `git stash list` - stashed changes
- `git reflog` - recent commits

**See:** ERROR_RECOVERY_PROTOCOL.md for recovery procedures

---

### 0.5. Plan Maintenance (Keep Notes Updated)

**Core principle:** Always maintain notes as you work. NEVER delete from plan files.

**Plan file location:** `plan/` - Implementation plans and active work (project root)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Plan File Location

**ALL plans MUST be created in `plan/` directory (project root).**

❌ **NEVER create plans in:**
- `~/.claude/plans/` or `~/.claude/` (user home)
- `.claude/` (project config directory)
- Any temporary location

✅ **ALWAYS create plans in:**
- `plan/plan-<name>.md` for new plans
- `plan/wip-<name>.md` when work starts
- `plan/done-<name>.md` when completed

✅ **Required during complex work:**
1. If a plan file exists (e.g., `plan/*.md`), update it as you discover:
   - Edge cases found during implementation
   - Design decisions made
   - Issues encountered and their resolutions
   - Status of each task (✅/🔄/❌)

2. Before ending a session or when making significant progress:
   - Update the plan with current state
   - Note any failing tests and their causes
   - Document what was learned

3. When tests fail:
   - Add the failure details to the plan BEFORE attempting fixes
   - Document the root cause once identified
   - This creates a record even if the session is interrupted

## ❌ NEVER delete content from plan files

- Only APPEND new information
- Mark outdated sections with ~~strikethrough~~ or "SUPERSEDED BY: ..."
- Keep history of failed approaches - they have value
- If an approach didn't work, document WHY before trying another

**Benefit:** If a session is lost, the plan file contains the full context needed to resume.

---

### 1. Verification Before Claiming

**Core principle:** Never claim success without proof

❌ **Forbidden without verification:**
- "Fixed" / "Complete" / "Working" / "All tests pass"
- ✅ checkmarks without command output
- Explanations instead of proof

✅ **Required:**
1. Run the actual command/test
2. Paste exact output
3. Let output prove success/failure

**Example:**
```bash
./qa/bin/test_everything
# [paste full output]
Exit code: 0
```

**See:** VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md for enforcement checklist

---

### 2. Communication Style

**Core principle:** Terse, direct, emoji-prefixed status lines

✅ **Do:**
- Start status lines with emoji (✅/❌/📁/🧪/🚀/📝)
- One-sentence responses for simple actions
- Direct statements, no hedging

❌ **Don't:**
- Politeness, reassurance, explanations
- "I'll help you..." / "Great news!" / "Unfortunately..."
- Multi-paragraph responses for simple tasks

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Tests pass (ruff + pytest: 1376)"
- ❌ "Great news! All tests passed successfully..."

**See:** `output-styles/exabgp.md` for full guidelines (activate with `/output-style exabgp`)

---

### 3. Test-Driven Development (TDD) 🚨

**Core principle:** Write tests BEFORE code. Tests define expected behavior.

## TDD Workflow (MANDATORY)

**STEP 1: Write tests FIRST**
```bash
# Create/update unit tests for new interface
# Tests MUST fail initially - this proves they test something
uv run pytest tests/unit/path/to/test.py -v  # Should FAIL
```

**STEP 2: Implement code to make tests pass**

**STEP 3: During development - run TARGETED tests**
```bash
# Run only the specific test file you're working on
uv run pytest tests/unit/specific_test.py -v

# Or a specific test function
uv run pytest tests/unit/specific_test.py::test_function -v

# DO NOT run ./qa/bin/test_everything repeatedly - it takes ages
```

**STEP 4: Before claiming "done" - run ALL tests**
```bash
./qa/bin/test_everything  # ALL 6 test suites - only at the end
```

**IF TESTS FAIL:**
1. **STOP** - Do NOT immediately try to fix
2. **Update plan file FIRST** (if one exists for this work):
   - Add entry to "## Recent Failures" section
   - Include: test name, error message, suspected cause
3. **THEN** proceed to fix
4. **After fixing**, update plan with resolution

**Template for failure entry:**
```markdown
### [Date] Test Failure: test_name

**Error:** [paste error message]
**Suspected cause:** [your analysis]
**Status:** 🔄 Investigating | ✅ Fixed | ❌ Blocked

**Resolution:** [what fixed it, or why blocked]
```

## Test Requirements by Change Type

| Change Type | Required Tests |
|-------------|----------------|
| Bug fix | Test that reproduces the bug (fails before fix) |
| New feature | Unit tests + functional tests if applicable |
| Refactoring | Verify existing tests cover the code |
| New `__init__` signature | Unit test: construct, verify properties |
| New factory method | Unit test: factory creates valid instance |
| Validation logic | Unit test: invalid input raises exception |

❌ **Forbidden:**
- Writing code before tests
- Claiming "Done" / "Fixed" / "Complete" without test verification
- Skipping the "tests fail first" step

✅ **Required before claiming success:**
```bash
./qa/bin/test_everything  # ALL 6 test suites
```

**Test locations:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/`
- Functional tests: `qa/bin/functional encoding/decoding`

**See:** TESTING_PROTOCOL.md for enforcement checklist

---

### 4. Coding Standards

**Core principle:** Python 3.12+, strict mypy, stable BGP APIs

✅ **Required:**
- Python 3.12+ syntax: `int | str` NOT `Union[int, str]`
- NO code requiring mypy config changes
- BGP APIs: keep `negotiated` parameter (stable API, unused OK)
- Fix type errors at root cause, NEVER use `# type:` comments
- `cast()` is acceptable ONLY when preceded by runtime type check (isinstance/hasattr)
  - Example: `if isinstance(x, bool): return cast(T, x)` ✅
  - Example: `return cast(int, value)` without check ❌
  - Prefer assertions/raises over fallback cast: `raise TypeError(...)` not `return cast(T, value)`
- **Buffer protocol:** Use `Buffer` NOT `bytes` for unpack method `data` parameters
  - Import: `from exabgp.util.types import Buffer`
  - Zero-copy slicing with memoryview; `bytes` forces copies
  - NEVER change existing `data: Buffer` back to `data: bytes`

✅ **Preferred: Programmatic Code Changes**
- Prefer writing Python scripts to perform bulk code changes over manual editing
- For repetitive changes (rename across files, update patterns, migrate APIs):
  - Write a script that reads, transforms, and writes files
  - Test the script on a subset first
  - Run once to apply all changes consistently
- Benefits: reproducible, auditable, less error-prone than manual edits
- Example: migrating 44 tests from `.labels = X` to `labels=X` parameter

❌ **Prohibited:**
- `Union[int, str]` instead of `int | str`
- Adding mypy suppressions or relaxed settings
- **ANY mypy `# type` comments** - includes `# type: ignore`, `# type: ignore[code]`, `# type: X`
  - These are workarounds that hide problems instead of fixing them
  - Fix the actual type issue at its source instead
- Removing `negotiated` parameter from pack/unpack methods
- Introducing asyncio (custom reactor pattern used)

**Linting:**
```bash
uv run ruff format src && uv run ruff check src  # Must pass
```

**See:** CODING_STANDARDS.md for complete standards

---

### 5. Solution Quality (Right Solution, Not Easy Solution)

**Core principle:** Always implement the RIGHT solution, not the easiest or lowest-impact one.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Quality Over Convenience

When fixing bugs or refactoring code:

✅ **DO:**
- Fix the root cause, not just the symptom
- Improve type annotations at the source (e.g., fix method return types)
- Refactor properly even if it touches multiple files
- Add missing attributes/methods to the correct class
- Follow established patterns in the codebase

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use `cast()` to silence type errors without fixing the underlying issue
- Use ANY `# type:` comments (ignore, ignore[code], type annotations)
- Apply workarounds that leave technical debt
- Choose minimal changes over correct changes
- Avoid touching other files when the fix belongs there

## Examples

**Bad:** Adding `cast()` in caller because method returns wrong type
**Good:** Fix the method's return type annotation at the source

**Bad:** Using `hasattr()` check before accessing an attribute
**Good:** Add the missing attribute/property to the class where it belongs

**Bad:** Duplicating code to avoid modifying shared module
**Good:** Modify the shared module correctly and update all callers

**Bad:** Returning `TypeA | TypeB` union mixing unrelated types
**Good:** Unify the types (e.g., EOR as special UpdateCollection with flags)

**Rationale:** Short-term convenience creates long-term maintenance burden. The "right" fix may take longer initially but results in better code quality and fewer future issues.

## 🎯 Session Start Workflow

### 1. Read this file (you just did) ✅

### 2. Read CODING_STANDARDS.md (MANDATORY every session)

```bash
# Read .claude/CODING_STANDARDS.md
```

This file contains Python style requirements, type annotation rules, and project-specific conventions that MUST be followed.

### 3. Check git state

```bash
git status && git diff && git diff --staged
```

If ANY modified/staged files: ASK user how to handle before starting work.

### 4. Check plan state

```bash
ls -la plan/
```

- List all active plan files
- For each, check status emoji in header (🔄 Active, 📋 Planning, ✅ Completed, ⏸️ On Hold)
- Report to user: "Active plans: [list with status]"
- Ask: "Which plan (if any) are we working on today?"

**If working on a plan:** Keep it updated throughout the session (see Plan Update Triggers below).

### 5. Load contextual protocols based on task

**Use decision tree below to determine which additional protocols to read.**

| Activity | Load Protocol | Size |
|----------|---------------|------|
| Git operations (commit/push/branch) | GIT_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md | 3.7 KB |
| Refactoring code | MANDATORY_REFACTORING_PROTOCOL.md | 3.2 KB |
| Test failures / debugging | FUNCTIONAL_TEST_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md | 8.9 KB |
| Creating documentation | DOCUMENTATION_PLACEMENT_GUIDE.md | 12 KB |
| Error recovery / mistakes | ERROR_RECOVERY_PROTOCOL.md | 2.9 KB |
| Feature development | *(covered in this file - see below)* | - |

### 6. Use decision tree if uncertain

See README.md "What Do You Want to Do?" table

---

## Git Workflow Essentials

**NEVER commit/push without explicit user request.**

**User must say:** "commit" / "make a commit" / "push" / "git push"

**Before ANY git operation:**
```bash
git status && git log --oneline -5
```

**Workflow:**
1. Complete work
2. STOP and report what was done
3. WAIT for user instruction
4. Only commit/push if explicitly asked

**See:** GIT_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md for complete workflow

---

## Plan Update Triggers

**When to update plan files (if working on a plan):**

### Mandatory Triggers (MUST update)
- ❌ **Test failure** → Document in "Recent Failures" BEFORE fixing
- 🚫 **Blocker discovered** → Add to "Blockers" section
- 💡 **Design decision made** → Add to "Decisions" or relevant section
- ✅ **Task completed** → Mark ✅ in progress table
- ✅ **Work completed** → Update plan status (🔄 → ✅) and `plan/README.md`
- 🛑 **Session ending** → Full plan review (see SESSION_END_CHECKLIST.md)

### What Counts as "Significant Progress"
Any of these means update the plan:
- Completed a task (even partial)
- Changed approach/strategy
- Discovered something unexpected
- Hit a blocker
- Made a decision that affects scope

### When a Plan is Completed
1. Update plan file status to `✅ Completed`
2. Update `plan/README.md` - move to "Recently Completed" section
3. Consider deletion after user confirmation (completed plans clutter the directory)

### Enforcement
Before ending ANY session where you worked on a plan:
- [ ] Plan file has "Last Updated" timestamp current
- [ ] All failures documented
- [ ] All blockers documented
- [ ] "Resume Point" section updated
- [ ] If plan completed: status updated and README.md updated

**See:** SESSION_END_CHECKLIST.md for complete checklist

## Contextual Loading Triggers

**You should load additional protocols when:**

**Git work detected:**
- User mentions: "commit", "push", "branch", "merge"
- About to run git commands
- → Read GIT_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md

**Refactoring detected:**
- User says: "refactor", "rename", "restructure"
- Multiple file edits planned
- → Read MANDATORY_REFACTORING_PROTOCOL.md

**Error/failure detected:**
- Test failure occurs
- User says: "wrong", "broken", "fix", "not working"
- → Read ERROR_RECOVERY_PROTOCOL.md

**Test debugging needed:**
- Functional test fails
- User asks about test failures
- → Read FUNCTIONAL_TEST_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md

**Creating documentation:**
- Creating new .md file
- User asks "where should I document..."
- → Read DOCUMENTATION_PLACEMENT_GUIDE.md

## Quick Reference: Forbidden Phrases

**Without verification (command + output pasted):**
- ❌ "Fixed" / "Complete" / "Working" / "Ready"
- ❌ "All tests pass" / "Tests pass"
- ❌ ✅ checkmark without proof

**Without running ./qa/bin/test_everything:**
- ❌ "Done" / "Finished" / "Complete"
- ❌ Any claim code works

**Without writing tests FIRST (TDD):**
- ❌ Implementing code before tests exist
- ❌ Skipping the "verify tests fail" step
- ❌ "I'll add tests later"

**Without explicit user request:**
- ❌ `git commit` / `git push`
- ❌ "I've committed..." / "I've pushed..."

**Auto-fix:** Stop. Write tests. Verify they fail. Implement. Verify they pass. Then claim.
