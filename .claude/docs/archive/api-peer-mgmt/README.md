# API Peer Management - Deleted

**Period:** Early development
**Status:** Complete - Files deleted

## What Was Here

Early planning documents for API peer management (2 files, ~23K total):
- PEER_MANAGEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- DOCUMENTATION_HANDOFF.md

## Why Deleted

Work integrated into production. Final documentation exists in:
- `src/exabgp/reactor/peer.py` - Peer management implementation
- `.claude/exabgp/CLI_COMMANDS.md` - Current API commands
- `.claude/exabgp/NEIGHBOR_SELECTOR_SYNTAX.md` - Neighbor selection syntax

Early planning docs provided no value over current implementation documentation.
