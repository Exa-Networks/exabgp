# Dual Transport - Deleted

**Period:** Early development
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Files deleted

## What Was Here

Early planning docs for dual transport (Unix socket + stdio) architecture (3 files, ~34K total):
- DUAL_TRANSPORT_API_PLAN.md
- DUAL_TRANSPORT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- SOCKET_STARTUP_CHECKS.md

## Why Deleted

Work completed. Final documentation exists in:
- `.claude/docs/projects/cli-dual-transport/` - Complete project docs
  - `README.md` - Project overview (644 lines)
  - `architecture.md` - Technical architecture (1045 lines)
- `.claude/exabgp/CLI_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - CLI implementation details

Early planning docs superseded by comprehensive final documentation.
