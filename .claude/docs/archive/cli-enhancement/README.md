# CLI Enhancement - Deleted

**Period:** Early development (2025-11-20)
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Files deleted

## What Was Here

Development tracking documents from CLI tab completion, auto-expansion, and interactive enhancement work (7 files, ~60K total).

## Why Deleted

Work completed and integrated into production. Final documentation exists in:
- `.claude/exabgp/CLI_COMMANDS.md` - Complete command reference (1315 lines)
- `.claude/exabgp/CLI_SHORTCUTS.md` - Shortcut reference (511 lines)
- `.claude/exabgp/CLI_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation architecture (1129 lines)
- `.claude/docs/projects/cli-dual-transport/` - Dual transport architecture

Development tracking docs provided no additional value over final documentation.
