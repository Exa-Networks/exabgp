Description: BGP route injector
 This program is a BGP route injector. The route injector can connect
 using either IPv4 or IPv6 and announce both IPv4 and IPv6 routes.
 .
 Potential use are :
  + Injection of service IPs like AS112 announcement
  + Temporary route redirection: more specific routes with
    different next-hop
  + Injection of flow routes to handle DDOS
