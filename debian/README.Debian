In all the examples stored under /usr/share/doc/exabgp/examples you
will see how you can connect to different BGP speakers and use the
features of ExaBGP. You need to put a configuration
`/etc/exabgp/exabgp.conf'. ExaBGP won't start if this file doesn't
exist.

However, In case you would mind how to complete your setup on the network side,
here is an IETF paper explaining RTBH and showing examples on different vendor platform.

For more information please look at ExaBGP's FAQ or the related talks/slide page of its wiki.
