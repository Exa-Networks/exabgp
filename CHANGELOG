 * Improvement: adding a 'ttl-security' to allow to explicit setup of TCP TTL
 * Improvement: better handling of BGP timer for keepalive
 * Improvement: refuse to run as root, try to run as nobody automatically, uid/gid set to the user defined by env USER otherwise
 * Removed: the old wiki documentation
 * Improvement: Debian Packaging (author and maintainer: Henry-Nicolas Tourneur - thank you)
 * Change: renamed env variable DAEMON to DAEMONIZE (to prevent name clash with Debian)
 * Improvement: added env variable PDB if set the program will call pdb, the python debugger, on program fault
 * Improvement: it is now possible to get some routes withdrawn from an external process (see watchdog example conf.)
    warning: this code is not yet considered production ready, expect some bugs for complex configurations
 * Improvement: it is now possible to modify the configuration without reload from external proccess (see process example conf.)
    warning: this code is not yet considered production ready, expect some bugs for complex configurations
 * Fix: make sure we can setup a session even if no route (ie: AFI/SAFI families for Mulitprotocol) are in the configuration
 * Fix: many small bug fixes, simple code refactorisation, ...

Version 1.2.0 - 25th of January 2011
 * Improvement: Allow to break route in more specific (ie define a /22 and get 4x /24 announced)
                This is useful when blackholing traffic to make sure no routes more specific are received from your network peer/transit
    requested by : Renaud Chaput
 * Improvement: Save the program PID into a file (set the PID= environment value with the file path)
    requested by : Renaud Chaput
 * Improvement: Add syslog support (env SYSLOG= nothing for local syslog, a file name (auto-rotate) or host:<host> for remote syslog)
    requested by : Josh Ward
 * Improvement: Can now daemonise (env DAEMON= detach and send the program in the background)
    requested by : Josh Ward
 * Improvement: Selection of what subsystems to log, more readable logs (well, less unreadeable to be exact)
 * Improvement: Create a new "group" in the configuration to share routes and configuration options between neighbors
    requested by : Multiple people
 * Fix: non detection of MD5 change on configuration reload
 * Improvement: support distutil with a setup.py file for easy installation

Version 1.1.0 - 10th of January 2011
 * Improvement: Tested and completed TCP MD5 signature
    contribution: MD5 TCP code by David Farrar

Version 1.0.4 - 8th of January 2011
 * Improvement: can now toggle debuging using environment values (DEBUG_CONFIGURATION, DEBUG_SUPERVISOR, DEBUG_WIRE)
 * Fix: some change to the AS_PATH generation code (some routers did not accept empty AS_PATH as it was encoded before)
    reported by: R.P. Aditya
 * Fix: some interoperability issue with openbgpd (could not parse their OPEN message)
    (issue 1) reported by Manuel Guesdon
 * Experimental: Some MD5 for Linux (untested - surely not working)

Version 1.0.3 - 6th of January 2011
 * Fix: missing default localpref on IBGP session if not specified on the route
 * Improvement: more verbose messages in case of OPEN negociation issue
 * Fix: typo preventing 4 Bytes ASN to work

Version 1.0.2 - 22nd of October 2010
 * Improvement: only try to generate UPDATE messages if the configuration was changed (save quite some CPU as the algorithm is really naive)
 * Fix : a neighbor configuration change could have been undetected on SIGHUP/SIGALRM
    reported by: Yann Berthier
 * Fix : reloading the configuration did not detect the removed routes
    reported by Renaud Chaput
 * Fix : a bug in the format of the UPDATE for route withdrawal causing Cisco (and not Quagga) to tear the session
    reported by Renaud Chaput

Version 1.0.1 - 7th of September 2010
 * Fixes an issue with some python versions (at least 2.5.2) when sending a large number of routes (several hundred). Some messages could be sent in multiple parts, causing the parser at the other end to barf (Thank you to Renaud Chaput for the bug report)
