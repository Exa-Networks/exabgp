Version 3.0.0 - 13 of July 2012 (unreleased experimental version)
 * Major version change due to incompatible CLI interface with version 1.x.x and 2.x.x
 * Major version change due to a change of API behaviour with the forked worker processes

 * Change : Many printed message have changed, including OPEN MultiProtocol
 * CLI Change: use new ini file and environment values for configuration
 * API Change: send "up" message to worker process when neighbour OPEN negotiation is complete (not on TCP up)
 * API Change: the format of the line sent to the worker changed, neighbor name include multi-session information
 * API Change: the down message sent to help programs now include a reason for the shutdown of the session
 * API Change: use the word withdrawn when the route was received, withdraw when it is an action, same for announce and announced
 * API Addition: send "connected" to worker when neighbour TCP session is established (replace previous 'up')
 * API Addition: requires peer-updates under 'process' to announce peer status changes
 * API Addition: show routes, show routes extensive, show neighbors
 * Fix: were not dropping root privileges correctly
 * Fix: reset counters correctly for number of routes seen (only affects the logs)
 * Fix: prevent 100% CPU usage/loop when trying to read on unreliable links
 * Fix: correctly process IPv6 routes with 32 bytes long next-hop
    reported by Daniel Piekacz (with patch, thank you)
 * Fix: problem on broken pipe with the helper program
 * Fix: correct sending of message to helper program (every worker was getting every peers messages)
 * Fix: if an helper program goes away, do not try to restart the peer (prevent surprises)
 * Fix: problem when writing too fast and causing EGAIN errno failure on the socket (mostly/only on Mac OSX)
    reported by Simon Helson (with patch, thank you)
 * Fix: a nasty bug when dynamic route announcement would not work when no routes were setup
    reported by Tim Gebbett
 * Fix: bad counting of routes parsed (not resetting in some case)
 * Fix: badly printed local-preference when generating route representation
 * Fix: bug when trying to daemonise ExaBGP, caused by unclosed FD
    reported by Ryan Lane (with a patch, thank you)
 * Fix: parse correctly routes with empty AS-SET or AS-SEQUENCE
 * Feature: hidden option to change BGP select timeout (use at your own risk - do not ask me where it is - it is hidden)
 * Feature: announce EOR even if Graceful-Restart was not negotiated but only MultiProtocol
 * Feature: implementation of draft-ietf-idr-bgp-multisession-06
    use capability 131 (and not 68) for multisession to achieve interop with Cisco
 * Feature: following RFC 6608 new notification codes

 * Feature: support for RFC 4456 (BGP Route Reflection: An Alternative to Full Mesh Internal BGP (IBGP))
    more exactly the generation and parsing of originator-id and cluster-list attributes
    requested by Rishabh Goel
