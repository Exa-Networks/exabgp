    Wait for ACK responses from ExaBGP.

    Polls STDIN until all expected ACK messages are received.

    Handles both text and JSON encoder formats:
    - Text: "done", "error", "shutdown"
    - JSON: {"answer": "done|error|shutdown", "message": "..."}

    Args:
        expected_count: Number of ACK messages expected (default: 1)
