    Wait for ACK responses from ExaBGP.

    Polls STDIN until all expected ACK messages are received.
    ExaBGP may not respond immediately, so we loop with sleep.
    Supports both text mode ("done"/"error") and JSON mode.

    Args:
        expected_count: Number of ACK messages expected (default: 1)
        timeout: Total timeout in seconds (default: 1)

    Returns:
        True if all ACKs received successfully
        False if any command failed or timeout occurred

    Raises:
        SystemExit: If ExaBGP sends shutdown message
