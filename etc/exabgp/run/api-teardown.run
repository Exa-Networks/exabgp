def wait_for_ack(expected_count=1, timeout=30):
    """
    Wait for ACK responses from ExaBGP.

    Polls STDIN until all expected ACK messages are received.
    ExaBGP may not respond immediately, so we loop with sleep.

    Handles both text and JSON encoder formats:
    - Text: "done", "error", "shutdown"
    - JSON: {"answer": "done|error|shutdown", "message": "..."}

    Args:
        expected_count: Number of ACK messages expected (default: 1)
        timeout: Total timeout in seconds (default: 30)

    Returns:
        True if all ACKs received successfully
        False if any command failed or timeout occurred

    Raises:
        SystemExit: If ExaBGP sends shutdown message
