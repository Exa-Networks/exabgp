BUGS:
 * If you find a bug we want to hear it.

FEATURE:
 * When parsing routes, warns if a route use the as-path feature in a ibgp connection and has the ASN in it, it is invalid and the router will drop the route.
 * Some of the match condition of flows currently take list or numeric tests, they should always take both, refactor the code for it (ports for example)
 * Modification of the RIB from the code (will be added as a parsing plugin)
 * Be graceful if the peer does not support multiprotocol and try without if we see an optional attribute error, an unsupported capability or a grouping conflict.
 * Add/Remove a default route in the local FIB if the BGP session is up/down

CODE IMPROVEMENTS:
 * Rewrite the unittesting which is really missing.
 * Look at all the XXX: in the code
 * reduce to a minimum all the new_ and to_ functions and integrate them into protocol
 * Formally define the interfaces used (perhaps ...)
 * We do not validate the flow created
 * reading stderr from forked process and displaying via the logger class
 * We can have exact duplicate routes in the configuration, and they will be announced twice even if identical
 * Do not announce route of a AFI/SAFI pair if the pair was not received on the OPEN by the peer

DOCUMENTATION:
 * Write the documentation, and do not rely on the example and the site wiki (argh ...)
